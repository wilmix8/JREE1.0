DisAdvantage  of  JAVA /j2ee p.l
==================================

As  we  see   JAVA Decompiler  known  as  "JAD"  in  website  http://www.javadecompilers.com/.

So  any  class file  of   JAVA (jdk1.6,jdl1.7,Jdk1.8) source  code  can  be  easily converted  to  java
source  code by  using  JAD Decompiler.  SO JAVA /j2ee  fails  completly.

Inorder to  eradicate  the demerits  JAVA7(OAK JAVA7)  a  new   Programming Language is introduced by  wilmix  jemin.


But  such (JAVA7) source  code cannot  be  executed  in  Java/j2ee parent compiler  and hence  avoids  the  demerits.
